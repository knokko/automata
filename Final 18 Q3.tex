Let $w \in \sum*$ be arbitrary. We need to define a function $f$ such that $w \in A$ iff $f(w) \in B$.
In other words, we need to define a function $f$ such that $w \in A$ iff $f(w) = f(w)^R$.\\
I think the solution would be something like $f(w) = ww^R$ if $w \in A$ and ab if not.
However, this doesn't feel like a proper solution at all. I hope someone knows a better way...\\
I have seen the solution $f(w) = ww^R$ seen being proposed, but that would work only if A accepts every word in the alphabet.

According to Erik during last year's examination review, this is the answer:

We need $f: \sum* \to \sum*$ such that:
1. f is computable
2. $\forall w \in \sum*$: $w \in A \iff f(w) \in B$
    Put f(w)= aba if $w \in A$, ab if $w \notin A$
    
f is computable because A is decidable, moreover:
$f(w) \in B \iff f(w)$ is a palindrome $\iff w \in A$
